# Schema Composition

The schema composition describes the process of merging multiple source schemas
into a single GraphQL schema, known as the _composite execution schema_, which
is a valid GraphQL schema annotated with execution directives. This composite
execution schema is the output of the schema composition process. The schema
composition process is divided into four major algorithms: **Validate Source
Schema**, **Merge Source Schema**, and **Validate Satisfiability**, which are
run in sequence to produce the composite execution schema.

## Validate Source Schema

## Merge Source Schemas

### Pre Merge Validation

### Merge

### Post Merge Validation

## Validate Satisfiability
