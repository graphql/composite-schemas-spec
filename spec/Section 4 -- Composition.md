# Composition

The composition of source schemas describes the process of merging multiple
source schemas into a single GraphQL schema called _composite execution schema_
that is annotated with execution directives. This single GraphQL schema is the
output of the composition process. The schema composition process is divided
into four algorithms, `Validate Source Schema`, `Merge`, and
`Validate Satisfiability` that are run in order and produce the composite
execution schema.

## Validate Source Schema

## Merge Source Schemas

### Pre Merge Validation

### Merge

### Post Merge Validation

## Validate Satisfiability
