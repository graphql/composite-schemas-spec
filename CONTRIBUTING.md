## Contributing to the spec text

### Adding spec examples

To keep things consistent in the spec, we should use examples that reference an e-commerce store. We should use types like `Product`, `User`, `Reviews`, etc.

### Adding new sections

Sections in the spec document are nested under top level sections, then topic sections, then specific sections. We should aim to limit to 3 nested levels and consider flattening once we reach 4 levels.
