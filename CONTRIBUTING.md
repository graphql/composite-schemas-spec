## Contributing to this repo

This repository is managed by EasyCLA. Project participants must sign the free
([GraphQL Specification Membership agreement](https://preview-spec-membership.graphql.org)
before making a contribution. You only need to do this one time, and it can be
signed by
[individual contributors](https://individual-spec-membership.graphql.org) or
their [employers](https://corporate-spec-membership.graphql.org).

To initiate the signature process please open a PR against this repo. The
EasyCLA bot will block the merge if we still need a membership agreement from
you.

[detailed information here](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/tree/main/membership).

If your company benefits from GraphQL and you would like to provide essential
financial support for the systems and people that power our community, please
also consider membership in the
[GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/join).

## Adding spec examples
To keep things consistent in the spec, we should use examples that reference an e-commerce store. We should use types like `Product`, `User`, `Reviews`, etc.
